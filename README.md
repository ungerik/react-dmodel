# react-dmodel

### Exploit JSX syntax to define data models and auto generate form UI for it

JSX is a handy format to define structured data within Javascript. react-dmodel uses it to define data models (typed data structs) including validation and optional binary encoding. This allows auto generating forms for the data model and with binary encoding creating files or network messages with a given binary format.


### To Do

* [ ] Validation error for every input in FormModal instead of global
* [ ] Deep nesting, fix forEachChildElementRecursive
* [ ] Publish npm package
* [ ] Support arrays
* [ ] Immutable.js compatibility
* [ ] Redux integration
* [ ] React stub to use JSX without importing all of React
* [ ] Complete test coverage
* [ ] More examples
